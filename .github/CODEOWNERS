# All PRs need to be approved by a member of the reviewers team
# Note that for this to work, the repository's access settings (https://github.com/DeepBlueRobotics/RobotCode2024/settings/access)
# need to be configured to allow the reviewers team (or a parent team like devs) to explicitly have write (or higher) access.
# It isn't sufficient for all org members to have write access.
